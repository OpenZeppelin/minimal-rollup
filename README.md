This is a POC for a set of smart contracts that achieve a minimal on-chain footprint on L1.

This implementation is inspired by the current Taiko protocol, and research described [here](https://gist.github.com/nikeshnazareth/9c7565cd49315644b3fe9ef9f3fdc2b1) and [here](https://gist.github.com/nikeshnazareth/2d76a9b2294b6a778cbd9fb0e6b47be5).
